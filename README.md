# NIST PFAS Data Repository

## About

This repository is a collection of data, source code, and other tools related to projects within the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) PFAS program. All information in this repository are in development, see the [License](License.md) file for additional information regarding the usage of the data in this repository.

The current projects within this repository include:
+ [NIST List of Possible Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances](suspectlist): The NIST List of Possible PFAS is a table containing user-submitted structures for possible PFAS, which can be used for suspect screening and other non-targeted analysis approaches. In addition, source code for functions related to analysis and filtering of the NIST List of Possible PFAS are provided within this directory.
+ [Non-Targeted Analysis - Method Reporting Tool](methodreportingtool): The NTA-MRT is a supporting tool for the [NIST mass spectrometry database program](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas/research/reference-data-and-tools) that enables users to submit the minimum metadata requirements to NIST, along with their raw MS data, via a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel workbook.
